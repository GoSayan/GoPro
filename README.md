# GoPro

Go is great language with an awesome community. A community that ranges from beginners to pros. Thinking a bit about it, I thought why not use some free time to harness our Go skills and GoPro :).

The idea here is to get experts from the community to review the code for the projects we develop. Some of us will have more knoweldge in Go than the others which is even better. The topics that we should build our projects on top of should include but not limited to:

- CI / CD
- Messaging
- API developement or usage
- DBMS
- ... and more

Add your suggestion for projects and your feedback to the GoSayan Slack channel.
